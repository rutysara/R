# Variables are case-sensitive

# To create variable you can use <- or = to give it a value. However, <- works in all situations while = has exceptions

# STANDARD 1 : <- for variables and = for functions

# The orientation of the arrow (<- or ->) is irrelevant as long as the arrow is pointing to the variable that you want to attribute a value to
c -> 10 #error, in any circumstance  you can attribute a value to a value
10 -> c

# As soon as a variable has a value, you can attribute the variable's value to another variable
c -> d

# STANDARD 2 : "Variable" <- "Value"

# Mathematical Operations

# Basic Methods

# Sum
5 + 5

# Subtraction
10 - 8

# Division
9 / 3

# Multiplication
4 * 2

# Power
4 ** 2
4 ^ 2

# Besides calculations, you can also ask questions to know quickly True or False questions
# Equal?
5 == 6
5 == 5

# Different?
5 != 6
5 != 5

# Both Greater or Lesser than?
4 > 2
2 > 4

3 < 2
3 < 4

# Both Greater (or Lesser) or Equal?
4 >= 5
4 >= 4

6 <= 8
6 <= 5

# AND
6 == 6 & 7 == 8
# Both have to be True
6 == 6 & 7 != 8

# OR
6 == 6 | 7 == 8
# In this case, if only one is True, the final reply will be True because OR is used

6 != 6 | 7 == 8
5 > 3 | 5 < 8

# NEGATE or CONTRARY
!6 == 6
!4 > 2
